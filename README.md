# Expense-Tracker-

The Expense Tracker is a responsive and interactive front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users manage their personal finances by tracking their income and expenses in real time. Users can add new transactions by specifying the title and amount, which dynamically updates the total balance, income, and expense sections on the dashboard.

The application uses JavaScript DOM manipulation to display transaction history and calculate totals. It also includes input validation to prevent incorrect entries. All styles are handled using modern CSS, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface that works well on various screen sizes.
This project demonstrates essential front-end development skills such as dynamic data handling, form validation, conditional rendering, and real-time UI updates.
